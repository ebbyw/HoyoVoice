## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Windows 10/11 support.** The pipeline now has a platform backend layer (`hv_platform/`) and runs natively on Windows: DirectShow video capture, in-process WASAPI audio, an OCR daemon (`tools/ocrd_win.py`) speaking the same protocol and coordinate convention as the Apple Vision one, Kokoro TTS through ONNX Runtime, `setup.ps1`, and a cross-platform `hoyovoice.py` launcher. `voices.json` carries over unchanged — the voice IDs are identical on both platforms. RapidOCR on DirectML is the recommended engine (~120ms/frame); the built-in Windows OCR is a fallback. Getting there meant solving a series of platform-specific problems, all handled internally: frames are read as validated complete images (a JPEG caught mid-rewrite yields no text at all), the background is flattened before recognition so light subtitles survive a blown-out sky, playback tracks the duration implied by its own sample count because PortAudio reports a stream idle while WASAPI is still sounding, and the Chinese-trained recognition model's habit of dropping spaces is repaired in post. See `plans/WINDOWS-TESTING.md` for the first-run checklist and the platform quirks worth knowing.
- **Message/group-chat panel reading.** Phone conversations are read incrementally as you scroll, each sender in their own cast voice, with system notices ("… started sharing location") read by the narrator since they're events rather than speech. Sender labels are canonicalised per conversation — OCR renders the same small label several ways — and messages whose label has scrolled off-screen inherit the conversation's name rather than falling back to the narrator.
- **Lore cards** — full-screen title-and-prose screens carrying no UI chrome — are recognised and read by the narrator. Their title reads as a nameplate to the dialogue classifier, so they were previously skipped as an unknown speaker.
- **Sentence streaming.** The typewriter pauses at sentence boundaries, so a completed sentence is spoken at that pause instead of waiting for the whole line; the remainder follows once it renders, after the first part finishes.
- **Per-speaker voiced prior ("soft gate").** Some voiceover sits below every audio threshold that can safely be used: measured on a real capture, a voiced line peaked at 0.18 on the speech detector while a genuinely *unvoiced* line in the same scene showed more sub-threshold activity — no global threshold separates them, and lowering one would silence the unvoiced lines this app exists to fill in. HoyoVoice now tracks how often each speaker turns out to be voiced and, once that's consistent, accepts much weaker evidence before talking over them. For a character with a real voice, silence is the safer error. It self-corrects: every line spoken for a character counts against the prior.
- **Session replay harness (`tools/replay.py`).** Any dashboard recording replays through the real pipeline — actual OCR daemon, classification, stabilisation, dedupe, VAD gate and yield, with only capture, TTS and playback simulated — in a throwaway state directory that can't touch real casting or caches. Every reported problem becomes a reproducible test case.
- **"⤓ Download log" button** in the dashboard. Saves one text file with the environment, live analytics, the casting table, the full decision log and the noise-filtered console log — enough to diagnose a session without a screenshot.
- **Screen kinds are labelled in the log** (`loading screen`, `lore card`, `narration`, `overlay`, `chat`, `chat notice`), on skips as well as reads, plus a `lost frames` analytic counting frames the OCR daemon couldn't read at all.

### Changed

- Platform code (capture, audio, OCR daemon, TTS, playback) moved out of `live.py` into `hv_platform/darwin.py` and `hv_platform/win32.py` behind a shared interface (`hv_platform/base.py`). macOS behaviour is intentionally unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Real voiceover was spoken over when the audio reader fell behind.** Under load the VAD tail-reader could trail the live edge, stamping stale audio with fresh timestamps — so the gate judged "now" against sound from minutes earlier. Backlogs over a second are dropped and the dashboard shows `LAG Xs`.
- **HoyoVoice kept talking when voiceover started mid-line.** The late-VO yield used the same strict thresholds as the gate, so it often never fired. Our own TTS is not in the capture — it plays on the computer's speakers — so any speech heard during playback is game voiceover by definition, and the yield now acts on much weaker evidence.
- **Loading-screen lore was silently skipped as a repeat.** The dedupe window persists across restarts so that restarting mid-scene doesn't re-read the line still on screen, but it never expired — so a loading screen seen every session was suppressed by a read from the previous one. It now goes stale after ten minutes.
- **A line already on screen could re-trigger, and a partly-read nameplate could split a character in two.** Stabilisation was keyed on speaker *and* text, but the nameplate read jitters independently of the line ("Goldy" for "Mysterious Goldy"), restarting the cycle. Jittered re-reads now continue stabilising the same line, and partial nameplates snap to the cast member by containment instead of auto-casting a duplicate with a different voice.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **False "skipped (voiced)" on fast subtitle transitions**: the VAD gate's 2s lookback could reach back before the current line appeared, so the *previous* speaker's voice-over tail counted as evidence that the new line was voiced (confirmed by replaying a session recording through the gate). The gate window — including the wait loops, center-energy speechiness floor, and the `gate=` log value — is now anchored to when the line first appeared on screen.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Center-energy VO detector**: mid/side stereo analysis with a speechiness floor catches robot and vocoder voices the speech model can't recognize — music swells (both channels) and center-panned SFX (no speechiness) are rejected
- `settings.pronunciations`: spoken-form substitutions applied at synthesis only ("Wishpower" → "Wish power")
- `settings.custom_words` + casting names fed to Apple Vision as a recognition vocabulary
- Reading repairs: OCR-dropped apostrophes restored via a safe contraction dictionary ("youre" → "you're"), decorative glyphs stripped ("~"), interjections voiced as words ("shh" → "shush"), expanded I/l fixes incl. capitals and stutters
- Bright cutscene narration reads via prose self-certification (previously only black screens)

### Fixed
- Ghost-box double reads (text fade-in makes Vision return overlapping stale + full boxes)
- Tail-fragment re-reads when VFX briefly hide a text row (substring/containment dedupe)
- Dialogue split across OCR fragments rejoins its visual row
- Log text selection is no longer interrupted by the refresh; recordings list is a fixed scrollable panel

### Removed
- Legacy `tools/ocr.swift` one-shot (superseded by the `ocrd` daemon)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Auto-casting**: every newly met character claims a distinct voice from a gender-guessed pool instead of sharing one default — scenes full of new NPCs sound like an ensemble. Auto-cast entries show as "(auto)" in Casting and persist; a manual assignment clears the tag. Pools reuse the least-assigned voice only when exhausted.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Pre-cast characters from the dashboard (**Add cast** form) before they appear in-game
- `settings.text_fixes` lexicon for proper nouns OCR mangles ("lason" → "Iason")
- Gender guess from name shape for unknown speakers (casting table remains authoritative)
- `settings.dashboard_bind` — open the dashboard to other machines you trust
- Dashboard: version in header, friendly voice labels ("Heart (AF)"), scrollable recordings panel, paused-feed placeholder

### Changed
- Dialogue detection is anchored to the nameplate — overworld and cinematic layouts both parse, wherever the box sits
- Split OCR fragments rejoin their visual row ('Error: Term' + '"Berserker"…')
- Typewriter-aware pacing: lines still growing (or ending mid-sentence) wait to be spoken whole; when a split does happen, the remainder is spoken after the prefix finishes instead of being skipped or interrupting it
- Kokoro clip silence trimmed: snappier line starts, tight extension handoffs
- Black narration screens with only the ▼ glyph (no "Continue" text) are read, gated by a dark-frame check

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8470 — live log (voice used, per-event 📷 screenshot previews, replay, Hide/Clear), casting table (assign with instant re-read, mute checkboxes, delete), pause/resume, test-speech box
- Live video preview with paused placeholder; video/audio **device pickers** with hot-swap, persisted in settings
- In-app **recording**: game video + game audio + TTS clips muxed at exact wall-clock offsets (+8dB TTS boost, yield-trimmed clips), crash-safe MKV raw, configurable save folder
- Performance analytics: VAD health, OCR/synth timings, spoken/skipped/yielded counts, lines per minute
- Sentiment-aware delivery: line sentiment nudges speech pace (excited faster, somber slower)
- New screen types: Quick Read books (incremental scroll reading), info screens (Participant Details), loading-screen lore, floating host bubbles (`settings.overlay_speaker`), system screens silenced
- Menu/board rejection: dialogue must be centered; unknown speakers and narration require the ✕ Continue hint
- Speaker hygiene: quoted names are distinct characters, org/location names route to narrator, sentence fragments can never register
- App starts paused; resume from the dashboard

### Changed
- Dedupe is a sliding 3-message window (fuzzy-matched) instead of permanent — replayed quests re-voice
- Latency reduced to ~0.5–0.7s (6 fps sampling, speculative synthesis during the VAD gate, 0.2s wait)
- Capture devices selected by name, not index

### Fixed
- Recording audio ran ~12% fast with crackling: ffmpeg's AVFoundation audio input silently drops ~12% of capture-device samples. Audio moved to sox/CoreAudio (bit-perfect); ffmpeg is video-only; recordings slice the continuous sox stream — no resampling anywhere
- Two-tier VAD gate catches short/soft VO that never crosses the strong threshold; VAD pipeline made non-blocking and lag-free
- OCR "l"/"I" confusion repaired before synthesis
- Capture auto-recovers from device resolution changes, unplug/replug, and OCR daemon crashes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Live capture pipeline: PS5 → Genki ShadowCast 3 → ffmpeg (4 fps frame sampling + 16 kHz audio tap)
- On-device OCR via Apple Vision (`tools/ocrd` daemon, compiled Swift)
- Dialogue classification for Honkai: Star Rail standard layout (speaker / dialogue / choices)
- Full-screen black narration layout detection
- Kokoro-82M local TTS via mlx-audio with per-character voice registry (`voices.json`)
- Voiced-line gate: Silero VAD (onnx, no torch) skips lines the game already voices
- Late-VO yield: our playback cuts instantly if game VO starts mid-line
- `always_voiced` registry list for characters whose VO evades speech detection
- Fuzzy line dedupe (normalized text + similarity match) persisted across restarts
- Startup audio warmup to ignore capture-stream transients
- `hoyovoice.sh` control script (start / stop / status / log / restart)

### Known issues
- `af_nicole` voice is broken in the prince-canuma/Kokoro-82M package
- Genshin Impact layout profile not yet implemented
- Choice options are detected but not spoken
