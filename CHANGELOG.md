# Changelog

All notable changes to HoyoVoice are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
Add entries under **Unreleased** as you work; move them into a dated version section when you tag a release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **False "skipped (voiced)" on fast subtitle transitions**: the VAD gate's 2s lookback could reach back before the current line appeared, so the *previous* speaker's voice-over tail counted as evidence that the new line was voiced (confirmed by replaying a session recording through the gate). The gate window — including the wait loops, center-energy speechiness floor, and the `gate=` log value — is now anchored to when the line first appeared on screen.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Center-energy VO detector**: mid/side stereo analysis with a speechiness floor catches robot and vocoder voices the speech model can't recognize — music swells (both channels) and center-panned SFX (no speechiness) are rejected
- `settings.pronunciations`: spoken-form substitutions applied at synthesis only ("Wishpower" → "Wish power")
- `settings.custom_words` + casting names fed to Apple Vision as a recognition vocabulary
- Reading repairs: OCR-dropped apostrophes restored via a safe contraction dictionary ("youre" → "you're"), decorative glyphs stripped ("~"), interjections voiced as words ("shh" → "shush"), expanded I/l fixes incl. capitals and stutters
- Bright cutscene narration reads via prose self-certification (previously only black screens)

### Fixed
- Ghost-box double reads (text fade-in makes Vision return overlapping stale + full boxes)
- Tail-fragment re-reads when VFX briefly hide a text row (substring/containment dedupe)
- Dialogue split across OCR fragments rejoins its visual row
- Log text selection is no longer interrupted by the refresh; recordings list is a fixed scrollable panel

### Removed
- Legacy `tools/ocr.swift` one-shot (superseded by the `ocrd` daemon)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Auto-casting**: every newly met character claims a distinct voice from a gender-guessed pool instead of sharing one default — scenes full of new NPCs sound like an ensemble. Auto-cast entries show as "(auto)" in Casting and persist; a manual assignment clears the tag. Pools reuse the least-assigned voice only when exhausted.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- Pre-cast characters from the dashboard (**Add cast** form) before they appear in-game
- `settings.text_fixes` lexicon for proper nouns OCR mangles ("lason" → "Iason")
- Gender guess from name shape for unknown speakers (casting table remains authoritative)
- `settings.dashboard_bind` — open the dashboard to other machines you trust
- Dashboard: version in header, friendly voice labels ("Heart (AF)"), scrollable recordings panel, paused-feed placeholder

### Changed
- Dialogue detection is anchored to the nameplate — overworld and cinematic layouts both parse, wherever the box sits
- Split OCR fragments rejoin their visual row ('Error: Term' + '"Berserker"…')
- Typewriter-aware pacing: lines still growing (or ending mid-sentence) wait to be spoken whole; when a split does happen, the remainder is spoken after the prefix finishes instead of being skipped or interrupting it
- Kokoro clip silence trimmed: snappier line starts, tight extension handoffs
- Black narration screens with only the ▼ glyph (no "Continue" text) are read, gated by a dark-frame check

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8470 — live log (voice used, per-event 📷 screenshot previews, replay, Hide/Clear), casting table (assign with instant re-read, mute checkboxes, delete), pause/resume, test-speech box
- Live video preview with paused placeholder; video/audio **device pickers** with hot-swap, persisted in settings
- In-app **recording**: game video + game audio + TTS clips muxed at exact wall-clock offsets (+8dB TTS boost, yield-trimmed clips), crash-safe MKV raw, configurable save folder
- Performance analytics: VAD health, OCR/synth timings, spoken/skipped/yielded counts, lines per minute
- Sentiment-aware delivery: line sentiment nudges speech pace (excited faster, somber slower)
- New screen types: Quick Read books (incremental scroll reading), info screens (Participant Details), loading-screen lore, floating host bubbles (`settings.overlay_speaker`), system screens silenced
- Menu/board rejection: dialogue must be centered; unknown speakers and narration require the ✕ Continue hint
- Speaker hygiene: quoted names are distinct characters, org/location names route to narrator, sentence fragments can never register
- App starts paused; resume from the dashboard

### Changed
- Dedupe is a sliding 3-message window (fuzzy-matched) instead of permanent — replayed quests re-voice
- Latency reduced to ~0.5–0.7s (6 fps sampling, speculative synthesis during the VAD gate, 0.2s wait)
- Capture devices selected by name, not index

### Fixed
- Recording audio ran ~12% fast with crackling: ffmpeg's AVFoundation audio input silently drops ~12% of capture-device samples. Audio moved to sox/CoreAudio (bit-perfect); ffmpeg is video-only; recordings slice the continuous sox stream — no resampling anywhere
- Two-tier VAD gate catches short/soft VO that never crosses the strong threshold; VAD pipeline made non-blocking and lag-free
- OCR "l"/"I" confusion repaired before synthesis
- Capture auto-recovers from device resolution changes, unplug/replug, and OCR daemon crashes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Live capture pipeline: PS5 → Genki ShadowCast 3 → ffmpeg (4 fps frame sampling + 16 kHz audio tap)
- On-device OCR via Apple Vision (`tools/ocrd` daemon, compiled Swift)
- Dialogue classification for Honkai: Star Rail standard layout (speaker / dialogue / choices)
- Full-screen black narration layout detection
- Kokoro-82M local TTS via mlx-audio with per-character voice registry (`voices.json`)
- Voiced-line gate: Silero VAD (onnx, no torch) skips lines the game already voices
- Late-VO yield: our playback cuts instantly if game VO starts mid-line
- `always_voiced` registry list for characters whose VO evades speech detection
- Fuzzy line dedupe (normalized text + similarity match) persisted across restarts
- Startup audio warmup to ignore capture-stream transients
- `hoyovoice.sh` control script (start / stop / status / log / restart)

### Known issues
- `af_nicole` voice is broken in the prince-canuma/Kokoro-82M package
- Genshin Impact layout profile not yet implemented
- Choice options are detected but not spoken
